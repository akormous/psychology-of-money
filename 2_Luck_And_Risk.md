# Luck & Risk

*Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems.*

## Do you know how Bill Gates became rich?
Bill Gates went to one of the only high schools in the world that had a computer.

- In 1968, there were roughly 303 million high-school-age people in the world, according to the UN.
- About 18 million of them lived in the USA.
- About 270,000 of them lived in Washington state.
- A little over 100,000 of them liven in the Seattle area.
- And only about 300 of them attended Lakeside School.
- Start with 303 million, end with 300.

One in a million high-school-age students attended the high school that had the combination of cash and foresight to buy a computer. Bill Gates happened to be one of them.

Gates is super smart and hard working, and as a teenager had a vision for computers that even most seasoned computer executives couldn't grasp. He also had a one in a million headstart by going to school at Lakeside.

Bill Gates also had a best friend during his school years, Kent Evans. He was as geeky and smart as Bill. He could  have been a founding partner of Microsoft with Gates and Paul Allen. But Ken died in a mountaineering accident before he graduated high school. (Read full story [here](https://www.distractify.com/p/kent-evans-bill-gates))

The odds of being killed on a mountain in high school are roughly one in a million. Bill Gates experienced one in a million luck, Kent Evans experienced one in a million risk. The same force, the same magnitude, working in opposite directions.

**Luck and Risk are both the reality that every outcome in life is guided by forces other than individual effort. They both happen because the world is too complex to allow 100% of your actions to dictate 100% of your outcomes.**

If you give luck and risk their proper respect, you realize that when judging people's financial success - both your own and others' - it's never as good or as bad as it seems.

When judging others, attributing success to luck makes you look jealous and mean, even if we know it exists. And when judging yourself, attributing success to luck can be too demoralizing to accept.

**It only makes sense to people, when something goes right, otherwise it was just a bad decision.**

We're all trying to learn what works and what doesn't with money.
- What investing strategies work? Which ones don't?
- What business strategies work? Which ones don't?
- How do you get rich? How do you avoid being poor?

Luck and Risk are doppelgangers. This is not an easy problem to solve. The difficulty in identifying what is luck, what is skill, and what is risk is one of the biggest problems we face when trying to learn about the best way to manage money.

But 2 things can point you in a better direction.

1. **Be careful who you praise and admire. Be careful who you look down upon and wish to avoid becoming.**

Or, just be careful when assuming that 100% of outcomes can be attributed to effort and decisions.

2. **Focus less on specific individuals and case studies and more on broad patterns.**

The more extreme the outcome, the less likely you can apply its lessons to your own life, because the more likely the outcome was influenced by extreme ends of luck and risk.

You'll get closer to actionable takeaways by looking for broad patterns of success and failure. The more common the pattern, the more applicable it might be to your life.

People who have control over their time tend to be happier in life is a broad and common enough observation that you can do something with it.

Bill Gates once said, "Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose."

But the same is true in the other direction.

Failure can be a lousy teacher, because it seduces smart people into thinking their decisions were terrible when sometimes they just reflect the unforgiving realities of risk.

The trick when dealing with failure is arranging your financial life in a way that a bad investment here and a missed financial goal there won't wipe you out so you can keep playing until the odds fall in your favor.

Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems.
